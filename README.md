**𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄 🚀:**

In this project, I embarked on a comprehensive analysis of Atliq Hardware, a leading company in the computer hardware industry. The primary objective was to empower the executive management team with actionable insights derived from a thorough examination of the company's data using MySQL, a robust relational database management system.

**𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 & 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵 🔧:**

To achieve this goal, I employed a multifaceted approach, leveraging the powerful capabilities of MySQL to delve deep into the company's data. This involved utilizing various advanced SQL techniques, such as Joins, to merge different datasets and extract valuable information. Additionally, I utilized Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to simplify complex queries and Subqueries to delve into specific aspects of the data.

Furthermore, I utilized PowerBI, an industry-leading data visualization tool, to create visually compelling dashboards and reports. PowerBI enabled me to transform raw data into interactive visualizations, allowing for a deeper understanding of key trends and patterns within the data.


**𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 & 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 💡:**

Through meticulous analysis, I uncovered a multitude of key metrics and insights that shed light on critical aspects of the company's operations. These included metrics such as Gross Profit, Average Manufacturing Cost, and Customer Acquisition Cost, among others. Armed with these insights, I formulated strategic solutions aimed at addressing identified challenges and capitalizing on opportunities for growth and optimization.

For instance, I proposed the implementation of innovative strategies such as the introduction of membership programs to foster customer loyalty, the offering of personalized gift certificates to incentivize repeat purchases, and the creation of bundled deals to increase average transaction value. Additionally, I recommended the adoption of targeted marketing initiatives, such as student discounts, to expand the company's customer base and drive revenue growth.


**𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜'𝘃𝗲 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗲𝗱 📚:**

This project served as a significant learning experience, allowing me to further develop and refine my skills in SQL and data analysis. By working with real-world data from Atliq Hardware, I gained invaluable hands-on experience in navigating complex datasets, identifying meaningful insights, and translating these insights into actionable recommendations for executive decision-making.

Moreover, the project provided me with a deeper appreciation for the importance of data-driven decision-making in today's competitive business landscape. By harnessing the power of MySQL and PowerBI, I was able to extract actionable insights from raw data, enabling the executive management team to make informed decisions that drive the company's success.
